Design Goal: Create a modern, premium, and friendly UI for the Smile Airline Loyalty Program website. The interface must be image-rich, clean, smooth in interactions, and highly attractive to encourage user engagement. Use a joyful airline theme with subtle animations and a professional yet welcoming feel.

1. Login & Registration Page
Full-width split screen:

Left panel: Large hero image (airplane in the sky, happy passengers, or destination view), Smile Airline logo, and a short inspiring slogan in English, e.g., "Fly More, Earn More, Smile Always".

Right panel: Card-style login form with:

Email field

Password field

Login button (bright, gradient blue → yellow)

Below form: Links for “Register” and “Forgot Password”

Soft background gradient behind both panels for depth.

Animation: Inputs glow slightly when active; button hover has a smooth ripple effect.

2. Main Dashboard (Post-login)
Header:

Left: Logo

Center: Main menu (Profile, Earning Rules, Requests, History, Redeem Points)

Right: User avatar with dropdown (settings, logout)

Body Layout:

Hero Section (Top):

Welcome banner with user avatar, name, points balance, and membership tier badge (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) over a soft destination photo background.

Quick Actions (just below hero):

Floating Action Button (FAB) for “+ Create New Point Request”, fixed at bottom-right of viewport, bright and attention-grabbing.

Other quick action cards: View Earning Rules, Redeem Points.

Main Content:

Earning Programs (image cards with hover zoom effect, “Join Now” button)

Redeem for Vouchers (carousel with voucher images, points needed)

Footer: Airline contact info, terms & conditions, social media icons.

3. Create New Point Request
Modal or dedicated page with large form cards:

Departure Airport (dropdown with search)

Arrival Airport (dropdown with search)

Departure Date (date picker with calendar pop-up)

Additional Notes (textarea)

Upon submit → Redirect to My Point Requests page with success toast notification.

4. My Point Requests
Top overview section:

Three statistic cards: Approved (green), Pending (yellow), Rejected (red)

Table view:

Columns: Request Date, Status (colored tag), Action (View Detail button)

View Detail → slide-in side panel with full request info (no page reload).

5. Point History
Full-width chart (smooth animated line or bar chart) showing:

Points Earned vs. Points Redeemed

Filter by Date Range

Small summary cards below chart: Total Earned, Total Used, Current Balance.

6. Profile Page
Two-column layout:

Left: User avatar with upload option, Membership Tier badge, Points Balance.

Right: Editable profile info (except Membership ID which is locked & greyed out).

Clean card sections with icons for each info category.

Design Style & UX Notes
Colors: Airline blue, gold accents, soft gradients.

Typography: Rounded sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Nunito) for friendly readability.

Images: Use high-quality travel and destination photos.

Animations: Smooth hover effects, soft page transitions, micro-interactions for clicks.

Responsive: Mobile-first, ensuring all elements scale gracefully.

Usability Priority: “Create New Point Request” is always visible and easy to click.

Layout Flow: Visual hierarchy — hero banner → quick actions → main programs → supporting sections.

Output expectation:

Provide a high-fidelity UI mockup for desktop and mobile views.

Include visual states for hover, active, and empty data scenarios.

Present both light mode and optional dark mode variations.
